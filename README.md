# Giving Up the Dream (posted 24/01/2022)

For just over 4 years, Ultz Limited (“Ultz”) has been home to a group of talented individuals/members who all share a vision to create something amazing using their skills and their time at their accord. 

The software team within Ultz have generated a large amount of intellectual property (IP), both open-source and closed-source, the results of which in some cases being unanimously recognised within their respective fields.

The artistic team within Ultz has consistently astounded & amazed, taking our ideas and putting their own spin on it to create genuinely beautiful art for our internal projects.

Passion is a unique, irreplaceable thing, and a lot of it has been put into Ultz, whether by the directors, software developers, or graphics designers; every individual in Ultz has shaped Ultz in a way that only they could. Unfortunately, being a member-driven organisation, when our passion runs out, or we’re unable to properly utilise it due to other constraints and other commitments, the thriving organisation slowly starts to fade.

The work created by our team has been truly beautiful, however unfortunately it must now come to a close. We had all dreamt one day that we could share our passion with the world, but with everything going on sometimes the best thing is to give up the dream, knowing that we gave it everything we possibly could.

Ultz Limited is now in the process of tying up loose ends, and in the coming months will regretfully close. We want to ensure what we have created has a life beyond us, and (for our open-source projects especially) will be leaving all our IP in good hands. Please watch this space for more information.

Thank you for being on this journey with us.
